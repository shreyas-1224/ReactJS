Why Hooks : 

sometimes, changing value of a boolean or variable will not change the existing UI and it has already
been rendering and to change the state, we need to reRender everything. For this purpose,we use React Hooks.

UI = f(x) , there are functions that allow us to hook into the state of app and read or
modify it.
